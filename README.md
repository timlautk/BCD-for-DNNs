# BCD-for-DNNs

Codes for An Accelerated Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) Algorithm for Training Deep Neural Networks

For the BCD algorithms, MATLAB is used. Use MATLAB R2017a or later versions. 

For the back propagation algorithm, Python (Jupyter Notebook) is used. Use TensorFlow 1.4 or later versions since Keras is included as a module in native TensorFlow 1.4 or later.
